<details id="details-ai-attitudes">
  <summary>My attitudes towards AI</summary>
  <ul>
    <li><span>Machine learning problems are analytical and statistical problems.</span></li>
    <li><span>Neural networks are good at discovering patterns not obvious to traditional approaches.</span></li>
    <li><span><abbr title="Large Language Model">LLM</abbr>s are probabilistic token predictors. They often intrinsically hallucinate.</span></li>
    <li><span>Garbage in, garbage out. Observation in, imitation out.</span></li>
    <li><span>I do use <abbr title="Large Language Model">LLM</abbr>s to brainstorm ideas.</span></li>
    <li><span>I do use <abbr title="Large Language Model">LLM</abbr>s to perform repetitive clerical work and typographical proofreading.</span></li>
    <li><span>I do chat with <abbr title="Large Language Model">LLM</abbr>s to have fun in my spare time.</span></li>
    <li><span>I do use <abbr title="Large Language Model">LLM</abbr>s to craft images for imagined scenes for hobby use.</span></li>
    <li><span>I do <em>not</em> use <abbr title="Large Language Model">LLM</abbr>s to write code for production use.</span></li>
    <li><span>I do <em>not</em> use <abbr title="Large Language Model">LLM</abbr>s to write casual articles, like blogs.</span></li>
    <li><span>I do <em>not</em> use <abbr title="Large Language Model">LLM</abbr>s to write academic articles or carry out research in place of myself.</span></li>
    <li><span>I do <em>not</em> use <abbr title="Large Language Model">LLM</abbr>s as a search engine.</span></li>
    <li><span>I do <em>not</em> trust <abbr title="Large Language Model">LLM</abbr>s as a sole source of information.</span></li>
    <li><span>I do <em>not</em> accept responses from <abbr title="Large Language Model">LLM</abbr>s without verification.</span></li>
    <li><span>I believe the loopholes and waivers in <abbr title="Large Language Model">LLM</abbr> hosting companies' <abbr title="End-User License Agreement">EULA</abbr> put much personal information at risk.</span></li>
    <li><span>I believe <abbr title="Large Language Model">LLM</abbr>s are energy hogs that should be used with conservation in mind.</span></li>
    <li><span>I believe <abbr title="Large Language Model">LLM</abbr>s are becoming more performant as theories and technologies evolve.</span></li>
  </ul>

## About this site

Some of my most recent posts are listed near the end of this page for convenient indexing. This section is anchored by [#section-recent-posts](#section-recent-posts). Alternatively, scrolling down below can also reveal this section.

All my posts are organized by one of more tags. A complete list of tags can be found at [/tags.html]({% link tags.html %}). A page search is usually sufficient to find the desired article.

I have some web apps hosted on GitHub Pages as well. Some of these are:

* [Periotris.js](/periotrisjs) ([repository](https://github.com/CSharperMantle/periotrisjs)): Variant of Tetris based on the periodic table of elements.
* [LA32R Instruction Statistics](/la32r-instr-stats) ([repository](https://github.com/CSharperMantle/la32r-instr-stats)): Count instructions in LoongArch32 Reduced binaries.
* [Y Chip Area Visualizer](/ysyx-chip-area-visualizer) ([repository](https://github.com/CSharperMantle/ysyx-chip-area-visualizer)): Visualize [Yosys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys) [`stat`](https://yosyshq.readthedocs.io/projects/yosys/en/stable/cmd/stat.html) reports.

I love static things. [No JavaScript is required for browsing my posts.]({% link _posts/2025-06-17-csmantle-top-javascript-usage.md %}) Animations are pure CSS and limited to the minimum. This site, same as most of my web apps, is statically generated and served. Therefore, your browser is not burdened with much rendering on the fly (which is often abused by React and other frameworks).

I am a Firefox user and [contributor](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/user_profile?user_id=774743), so my sites are mostly tested on Firefox ([aurora channel](https://mozilla.github.io/process-releases/draft/development_overview/#:~:text=mozilla-aurora)). I've also put efforts in making my site look consistent across modern Firefox and Chromium versions.

This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with a heavily-customized version of the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme. Its source code can be found at <https://github.com/CSharperMantle/CSharperMantle.github.io>.

Not much <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr> is done on this site. Thank you for stopping by and taking a look.
