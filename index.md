<details id="details-ai-attitudes">
  <summary>My attitudes towards <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></summary>
  <ul>
    <li><span>Machine learning problems are analytical and statistical problems.</span></li>
    <li><span>Neural networks are good at discovering patterns not obvious to traditional approaches.</span></li>
    <li><span><abbr title="Large Language Model">LLM</abbr>s are probabilistic token predictors. They often intrinsically hallucinate.</span></li>
    <li><span>Garbage in, garbage out. Observation in, imitation out.</span></li>
    <li><span>I do use <abbr title="Large Language Model">LLM</abbr>s to brainstorm ideas.</span></li>
    <li><span>I do use <abbr title="Large Language Model">LLM</abbr>s to perform repetitive clerical work and typographical proofreading.</span></li>
    <li><span>I do chat with <abbr title="Large Language Model">LLM</abbr>s to have fun in my spare time.</span></li>
    <li><span>I do use generative models to craft images for hobby use.</span></li>
    <li><span>I do <em>not</em> use <abbr title="Large Language Model">LLM</abbr>s to write code for production use.</span></li>
    <li><span>I do <em>not</em> use <abbr title="Large Language Model">LLM</abbr>s to write casual articles, like blogs.</span></li>
    <li><span>I do <em>not</em> use <abbr title="Large Language Model">LLM</abbr>s to write academic articles or carry out research in place of myself.</span></li>
    <li><span>I do <em>not</em> use <abbr title="Large Language Model">LLM</abbr>s as a search engine.</span></li>
    <li><span>I do <em>not</em> trust <abbr title="Large Language Model">LLM</abbr>s as a sole source of information.</span></li>
    <li><span>I do <em>not</em> accept responses from <abbr title="Large Language Model">LLM</abbr>s without verification.</span></li>
    <li><span>I believe the loopholes and waivers in <abbr title="Large Language Model">LLM</abbr> hosting companies' <abbr title="End-User License Agreement">EULA</abbr> put much personal information at risk.</span></li>
    <li><span>I believe <abbr title="Large Language Model">LLM</abbr>s are energy hogs that should be used with conservation in mind.</span></li>
    <li><span>I believe <abbr title="Large Language Model">LLM</abbr>s are becoming more performant as theories and technologies evolve.</span></li>
  </ul>

## About this site

Some of my most recent posts are listed near the end of this page for convenient indexing. This section is anchored by [#section-recent-posts](#section-recent-posts). Alternatively, scrolling down below can also reveal this section.

All my posts are organized by one of more tags. A complete list of tags can be found at [/tags.html]({% link tags.html %}). A page search is usually sufficient to find the desired article.

I have some web apps hosted on GitHub Pages as well. Some of these are:

* [Periotris.js](/periotrisjs) ([repository](https://github.com/CSharperMantle/periotrisjs)): Variant of Tetris based on the periodic table of elements.
* [LA32R Instruction Statistics](/la32r-instr-stats) ([repository](https://github.com/CSharperMantle/la32r-instr-stats)): Count instructions in LoongArch32 Reduced binaries.
* [Y Chip Area Visualizer](/ysyx-chip-area-visualizer) ([repository](https://github.com/CSharperMantle/ysyx-chip-area-visualizer)): Visualize [Yosys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys) [`stat`](https://yosyshq.readthedocs.io/projects/yosys/en/stable/cmd/stat.html) reports.

I love static things. [No JavaScript is required for browsing my posts.]({% link _posts/2025-06-17-csmantle-top-javascript-usage.md %}) Animations are pure <abbr title="Cascading Stylesheet">CSS</abbr> and limited to the minimum. This site, same as most of my web apps, is statically generated and served. Your browser is not burdened with excessive <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> manipulation (which is often abused by React and other frameworks). You can freely [`curl`](https://curl.se/) my site and [`wget`](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) it, as long as you respect the license listed near the bottom.

I am a Firefox user and [contributor](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/user_profile?user_id=774743), so my sites are mostly tested on Firefox ([aurora channel](https://mozilla.github.io/process-releases/draft/development_overview/#:~:text=mozilla-aurora)). I've also put efforts in making my site look consistent across modern Firefox and Chromium versions.

This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with a heavily-customized version of the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme. Its source code can be found at <https://github.com/CSharperMantle/CSharperMantle.github.io>.

Not much <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr> is done on this site. Thank you for stopping by and taking a look.
