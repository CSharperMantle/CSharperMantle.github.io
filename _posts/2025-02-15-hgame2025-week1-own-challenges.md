HGAME 2025 ([Hello-CTF link](https://github.com/ProbiusOfficial/Hello-CTFtime/issues/213)) is a introductory CTF challenge organized by [Vidar-Team](https://github.com/vidar-team/), running from [2025-02-03 20:00 GMT+8](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20250203T120000&p1=33) to [2025-02-17 20:00 GMT+8](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20250217T120000&p1=33). It is comprised of two *WEEK*s, each lasting for 7 days. It's mainly a recruiting competition for Vidar-Team in Hangzhou Dianzi University, but it's also open to the public.

I am delighted to prepare and present some of the challenges in the game, and I hope that you players could enjoy the game as well!

Aside from the official writeup (GitHub link TBA post-game), I personally publish the source code for my own challenges, so as to benefit archival and study purposes.

This post lists my challenges in WEEK1, which is now over. You can also use the comment feature near the end of this post to interact with me.
