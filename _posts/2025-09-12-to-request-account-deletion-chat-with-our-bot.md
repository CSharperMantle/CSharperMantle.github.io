**TL;DR:** I didn't succeed in deleting my account as of this writing.

Recently, I received an email from Groq titled "Updates to Groq's Terms & Policies". I registered on Groq quite a while ago with my Google account, and I didn't use it ever since. So, I decided to delete my account.

I logged in on their "Console" at console\[.\]groq\[.\]com and went to the "Settings" page. I scoured for a button like "Delete Account", but in vain. Basically, the available tabs on the left were:

* Organization
  * General
  * Billing
  * Team
  * Profile
  * Limits
  * Usage
  * Model Terms
  * Projects
  * Data Controls
* Project
  * General
  * Limits

"Organization - General" contained a textbox to change the organization name, and another one to copy its ID. "Billing" offered an upgrade to "Developer tier" or "Enterprise tier". "Profile" allowed me to change my avatar and subscribe to their newsletter. "Data control" let me control how the platform stores and keeps my input to AI models. None of them contained a button to delete my account.

"It's just hiding somewhere," I encouraged myself. I went to their "Docs" site at console\[.\]groq\[.\]com/docs, and searched the keywords "delete", "account deletion" and "delete account" using the built-in search. Nothing but API references.

I turned to search engines and typed "groq delete account" into the searchbox. The first answer came from "Groq Community":

> Contact support to request account deletion (Visit Groq Console â†’ Click Organization Name on upper righthand corner â†’ Select Chat with us from the dropdown menu). Note that this will permanently remove all API keys, usage history, and account data.
>
> -- <https://community.groq.com/t/how-do-i-delete-my-groq-account/52>

I was on mobile when I did all that. Clicking anything on "upper right corner" opens up a panel which displayed no dropdown menu, less for something called "Chat with us".

After waking up my laptop I could finally "Chat". A panel opens up on the lower right corner, saying:

> \[GroqCloud icon\] \[avatar 1\] \[avatar 2\] \[avatar 3\]
>
> **Hi there ðŸ‘‹**
>
> **Questions? Feedback? We're here to help.**
> 
> * View API/Model Status
> * Check Out Our Documentation
> * Ask The Community
> 
> * Send us a message

I guessed I need to "Send them a message" since Item 1 was not relevant, Item 2 was not helping, and Item 3 led me here.

> Hi! ðŸ‘‹ What can we help you with?
> 
> Groq â€¢ Just now
>
> < Account Question | Technical Question
> < Rate Limit Increase | Report an Issue

I selected "Account Question".

> What's going on with your account?
>
> Groq â€¢ Just now
>
> < Create an Account | Upgrade Account
> < Account is Restricted | Delete Account
> < Billing Questions | Other

I selected "Delete Account".

> Thank you for your account deletion request. Please note that if we complete this request, all account and usage data with Groq will be permanently deleted and cannot be recovered. To proceed, we need to first verify your identity. Can you please provide your organization ID below for verification?
> We are always looking to improve and would appreciate any more context on the reason you're looking to delete your account. Please share any feedback for Groq and how we could improve in the future.
>
> Groq â€¢ Just now

I typed in my "Organization ID" from far above.

... Then, deafening silence.

They could have designed a deletion button straight into the Console. After all, nothing can prove the user's identity than a valid login.

I haven't heard from Groq as of this writing. I think I'll just have to wait.
