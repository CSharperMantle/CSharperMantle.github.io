This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with a heavily-customized version of the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme. Its source code can be found at <https://github.com/CSharperMantle/CSharperMantle.github.io>.

I love static things. [No JavaScript is required for browsing my posts.]({% link _posts/2025-06-17-csmantle-top-javascript-usage.md %}) Animations are pure <abbr title="Cascading Stylesheet">CSS</abbr> and limited to the minimum. This site, same as most of my web apps, is statically generated and served. Your browser is not burdened with excessive <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> manipulation (which is often abused by React and other frameworks). You can freely [`curl`](https://curl.se/) my site and [`wget`](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) it, as long as you respect the license listed near the bottom.

I am a Firefox user and [contributor](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/user_profile?user_id=774743), so my sites are mostly tested on Firefox ([aurora channel](https://mozilla.github.io/process-releases/draft/development_overview/#:~:text=mozilla-aurora)). I've also put efforts in making my site look consistent across modern Firefox and Chromium versions.
I have some web apps hosted on GitHub Pages as well. Some of these are:

* [Periotris.js](/periotrisjs) ([repository](https://github.com/CSharperMantle/periotrisjs)): Variant of Tetris based on the periodic table of elements.
* [LA32R Instruction Statistics](/la32r-instr-stats) ([repository](https://github.com/CSharperMantle/la32r-instr-stats)): Count instructions in LoongArch32 Reduced binaries.
* [Y Chip Area Visualizer](/ysyx-chip-area-visualizer) ([repository](https://github.com/CSharperMantle/ysyx-chip-area-visualizer)): Visualize [Yosys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys) [`stat`](https://yosyshq.readthedocs.io/projects/yosys/en/stable/cmd/stat.html) reports.

Not much <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr> is done on this site. Thank you for stopping by and taking a look.
