#### Funding:

Thanks for stopping by and considering support me!

As you can probably tell, I write software mostly out of interest, and if any of my projects can be useful to you, entertain you or support your life in any way, I will be happy to hear that!

Further more if it is possible for you to donate to my works, it will be easier for me to continue devoting to FOSS projects in my spare time.

There are 2 ways to fund me:
- By **Liberapay**: https://liberapay.com/CSharperMantle
- By **Ai Fa Dian**: https://afdian.net/@CSharperMantle (strongly recommended for Chinese users as it is native to China and supports WeChat Pay and Alipay)
